This is my solution to the Naimuri Coding Challenge: Word Square!

This application, when run from the `Main.java` file, will attempt to create & display word squares. 

Either a single one (based user `cmd` args), or a set (provided by the challenge document)

***Setup***

Ensure Java 25+ is installed

Without arguments:

	run `java <route-to-project>\src\Main.java`

With arguments:
	
	run `java <route-to-project-folder>\src\Main.java <squareSize> <letters>`
